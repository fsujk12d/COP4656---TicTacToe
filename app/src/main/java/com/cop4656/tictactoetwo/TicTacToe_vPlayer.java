     *  This class is an empty subclass of TicTacToe_Base. It exists pretty much only for
     *  encapsulation purposes. It is used for games vs player, and there is no additional code
     *  here as there are no methods or data members that are necessary for Player v Player games
     *  that are not necessary for Player v Computer games. Part of the reason for its existence
     *  is so that calls to constant data members of the Base class from the PvP or PvC Activities
     *  can use consistent naming (both call TicTacToe_vAPPLICABLE instead of one calling Base and
     *  the other calling the other subclass).
