# COP4656---TicTacToe
Group Project for Mobile Programming. TicTacToe with vs Player and vs Comptuer modes.

This project was the group final project for COP4656 Mobile Programming at Florida State UIniversity for the Summer 24 term. 
My groupmates (Mihye Lin and Bradly Lashley) and I created this TicTacToe game, which has both Player vs Player AND Player vs 
Computer modes, with a difficulty select screen for vs Computer. The easy difficulty selects a random available square for the 
computer's next move, while the hard mode implements the minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move for the computer to play.
